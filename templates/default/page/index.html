        <h2>Welcome to The <?$FullName?></h2>
        <p>
            The <?$FullName?> (<?$ShortName?>) is a weekly, no-check, co-ed, adult pickup game
            designed for intermediate/advanced players in south-central Wisconsin. The
            <?$ShortName?> was formed by a group of players that were looking for a fast but
            friendly pickup game in a non-competitive environment. If you are looking to meet
            new friends, get a great work out and improve/maintain your hockey skills over the
            summer, you are in the right place.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <?$ShortName?> is primarily a members-only summer club, but we accept vetted
            non-member players on a weekly basis. If you are interested in joining or just playing
            with the <?$ShortName?>, please send a message to our
            <a href="mailto:<?$AdminEmail?>">administrator</a> and let us know. All players (members
            or guests) are expected to adhere to the <?$ShortName?> <a href="/rules.html">Rules and Code of Conduct</a>.
        </p>
