    <h2>Welcome to The <?$FullName?></h2>

    <p>The <?$FullName?> (<?$ShortName?>) is a weekly, no-check, co-ed,  adult pickup game designed
       for intermediate/advanced players in south-central Wisconsin.  The <?$ShortName?> was formed by a group of
       players that were looking for a fast but friendly pickup game in a non-competitive environment.
       If you are looking to meet new friends, get a great work out and improve/maintain your hockey
       skills over the summer, you are in the right place.
    </p>

    <p>The <?$ShortName?> is primarily a members-only summer club, but we accept vetted non-member players on a
       weekly basis.  If you are interested in joining or just playing with the <?$ShortName?>, please send a
       message to our <a href="mailto:<?$AdminEmail?>">administrator</a> and let us know.  All
       players (members or guests)  are expected to adhere to the <?$ShortName?> Rules and Code of Conduct.
    </p>
